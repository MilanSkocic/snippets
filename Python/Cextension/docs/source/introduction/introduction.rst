Description
============

Simple examples of C extensions, either by wrapping or directly writing C code,
for Python with the associated documentation.
The documentation is build using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ for the pure Python code and
`Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_ for the C code. Breathe is used to glue
the Doxygen xml output into the sphinx html/latex output.

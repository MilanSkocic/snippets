Description
============

Simple examples of C (using Python C API) and Fortran using (f2py) extensions.
The documentation is build using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ for the pure Python code and
`Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`_ for the C and Fortan code.
Breathe is used to glue the Doxygen xml output into the sphinx html/latex output.

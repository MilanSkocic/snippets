# Description

Simple examples of C (using Python C API) and Fortran using (f2py) extensions.
The documentation is build using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for the pure Python code and
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) for the C and Fortan code.
Breathe is used to glue the Doxygen xml output into the sphinx html/latex output.

The compilation was tested on Windows, MacOS and Linux (Debian 10).
